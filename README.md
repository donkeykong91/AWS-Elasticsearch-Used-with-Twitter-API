This grabs all of the "#trump" tweets and it uses elasticsearch to index them and kibana visualizes them with three graphs. 

One graph shows a tag cloud of the places that mostly tweet about #trump
Second graph shows a line of count of tweets that are created with regard to time
Third graph shows a pie chart of the timezones from where the tweets are comming
